# Using `is-in-viewport` in an ES6/ES2015 module
-----

Run `npm install && npm start` and point your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to see the running example.

The code is bundled using [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup).
You can see how it used in [main.js](./main.js) and see the [bundling config](./rollup.config.js) on how the bundling is done.

Since `is-in-viewport` declares `jquery` as a peer dependency, make sure you have it installed as that is the copy it attaches itself onto.
